!! Welcome in this project !!

**Running the Project**
1. Execute prediction.py.
2. Open your browser and go to the URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000 to interact with the project interface.

**Project Structure**
This folder contains several sub-folders:
- illustration: Includes heatmaps and visualizations for each dataset.
- Original_csv: Contains the original, raw CSV files used in the project.
- Modified_csv: Contains the cleaned and prepared CSV files after data preprocessing.
- Other:
    Includes html pages (GoogleSheet exported page) files outlining different parts of the project. The GoogleSheet link : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bT3qoy1FP4bGrVJAuQRiVFrok4q0DHlEpAZMhzgevFE/edit?gid=0#gid=0
    Contains the project presentation delivered during Week 6.
- static/css: Contains the CSS styles for the web interface.
- templates: Contains the HTML files for the web application pages.
The main folder also contains several Python scripts, each of which was used for tasks like data analysis, cleaning, and model development.

**Project Critique**
Dataset limitations: It would be more insightful to build a dataset specifically designed to link stress levels with academic performance. The current dataset does not provide a direct connection between these variables.
Feature limitations: Only 7 basic features were used to predict each target variable. While this offers a good preliminary overview, it's not sufficient to make reliable, detailed conclusions. Expanding the feature set would improve the model's performance and provide more actionable insights.
